# Introduction:

We have created Single View of Customer (SVOC) from the tables present in the database provided by the Cactus team.

We have prepared SVOC in SQL which will be used as follows: -
1) Creating the development dataset for building the Model
2) Scoring Models in R.

# Valuable-customer-prediction-model

Predicting most valuable customers based on the transaction history for a research paper publication house.
